# Syker√∂Labs3

- Automating my [NFT (Nutrient Film Technique)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient_film_technique) driven greenhouse
- 3rd iteration made with [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/) & [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) on [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
	- See previous (2nd version) on Raspberry Pico in https://github.com/visuve/SykeroLabs2 
- See [Sykerolabs 3 wiki](https://github.com/visuve/SykeroLabs3/wiki) for technical illustrations and pictures i.e. the full documentation
	- The documentation below is only for building, debugging etc. the application itself

## Build

- Sykerolabs3 uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) you need to install it first
- You can use [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) on your Raspberry Pi
	- Note that GCC is installed by default on Raspberry Pi OS and the Clang builds have not been tested 
	- See examples in [ubuntu.yml](https://github.com/visuve/SykeroLabs3/blob/master/.github/workflows/ubuntu.yml) on how to build the project
- At the moment Sykerolabs uses no other than C++ standard libraries, i.e. there are no dependencies
- I use Visual Studio with the *"Linux and embedded development with C++"* workload
	- Sometimes I use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) when developing stuff that does not need [GPIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output) related things

## Debug

- The application produces [CSV data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) of the states of the attached relays & probes
	- On release builds the data goes into timestamped files in ``~/sykerolabs`` and on debug builds the data is printed to console
- The application also produces event logs which can be viewed with ``journalctl -f -t sykerolabs`` for debugging purposes
	- Assuming you use systemd on the target OS (which is default on the Raspberry Pi OS)...
	- See https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/journalctl.html for more details

## Deploy

- Once you are done with your changes, run cmake install target
	- NOTE: you do not need sudo or root. Sykerolabs should be run as a regular user
	- See [build](#Build) section and then ``cmake --install``
- CMake will copy the executable in the users home directory and the [sykerolabs.service](https://github.com/visuve/SykeroLabs3/tree/master/src/sykerolabs.service) to ``~/.config/systemd/user/`` which is a user specific systemd unit directory
	-  See https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html for more details
- To take the service unit into use you need to run
	- ``systemctl --user daemon-reload`` for systemd re/load the sykerolabs.service
	- ``systemctl --user start sykerolabs.service`` to start the service
	- ``systemctl --user status sykerolabs.service`` to check the status
	- ``systemctl --user enable sykerolabs.service`` to enable on boot (assuming the status is okay)
	- ``systemctl --user stop sykerolabs.service`` to stop the service if needed
	- ``systemctl --user disable sykerolabs.service`` to disable the service on boot
- Important: run ``sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`` for systemd not to kill the service after logout!
